This is a collection of day-to-day utilities for Lua programming (5.1 and LuaJIT). Originally part of core libraries for the Lua framework utilizing my game engine, now has been split and separately maintained.
With that being said, code quality is not the greatest and it also lacks unit testing. This will be corrected and improved over time.

What's currently offered:
* Extra string, table, IO, file system & numerical processing functions
* Software-based bit manipulation routines
* Abstract, OS-independent layer for calling into platform native APIs (require FFI)

Requires a working installation of [LuaFileSystem](https://github.com/lunarmodules/luafilesystem).
